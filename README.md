Greetings!!ðŸ‘‹<br>
This is my first Web Dev project.<br>
In this project I have made My Portfolio which is divided in 2 parts.<br>
Lab1- It contains the basic layout and overall structure of the portfolio only using html and without using css.<br>
Lab2- It contains the same portfolio but with the magic of css ,enhancing the portfolio's style and the user's experience.<br>
Thank You ðŸ˜Š
