Lab 3:

Portfolio Website – HTML & CSS Update

In this assignment, I improved my previously created personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. 
I reorganized the layout with Flexbox and CSS Grid, added hover effects and simple animations, and made the design responsive so it works well on different screen sizes. 
I also cleaned up each section including the hero, about, projects, skills, and contact form to make the overall website look more polished and beginner friendly.
