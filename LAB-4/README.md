This project is a simple JavaScript quiz game that runs entirely in the browser console. 
It uses a quizQuestions array to store questions. The runQuiz function iterates through questions using a for loop, collects answers with prompt, and provides feedback with alert.
The game tracks the score and displays the final result at the end.
